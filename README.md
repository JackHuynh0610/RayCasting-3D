# RayCasting-3D

This program is a continuation of the [**RayMarching**](https://github.com/JackHuynh0610/RayMarching). This has a twist to it, by converting 2D plane into 3D.

- [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting#:~:text=The%20idea%20behind%20ray%20casting,eye%20sees%20through%20that%20pixel.) 🌐 I think wiki is not bad.

## Overview 🚀

This program is written using Java and the JavaSwing library just like RayMarching. Use your mouse pad or any device that allows the cursor to move to navigate and manipulate the camera. Use Left/Right arrow keys to change camera perspective.

## Prerequisites 🛠️
- First, you'll need to have [**JRE**](https://www.guru99.com/how-to-open-a-jar-file.html#:~:text=You%20need%20a%20Java%20Runtime,and%20it%20will%20start%20running.) to run the [**jar**](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jar/jarGuide.html) file for this program.
- If you already have **JRE** installed, proceed to **Getting Started** section.

**Check for JRE on your system:**
- For _macOS and Linux_:
  - Open a terminal window. Type in
    ```
     java -version
    ```
- For _Windows_:
  - Open Command Prompt. Type in
    ```
     java -version
    ```

### Getting Started 🚀
- **Option 1**
  - Navigate to the **_release_** section in the [**repository**](https://github.com/JackHuynh0610/RayMarching). Click on **RayCasting alpha**.
  - Download the **.jar** file. Remember where you installed it, navigate to that folder, double-click on it, and then enjoy!
- **Option 2**
  - Clone this repository, navigate to the jar file, and then run it. By cloning, you can explore the source code and test things out on your machine.

### Troubleshoot 🛠️
- If you have **JRE** installed but the program still won't run
  - Check the Environment Path. This [**link**](https://www.javatpoint.com/how-to-set-path-in-java) might be helpful.
